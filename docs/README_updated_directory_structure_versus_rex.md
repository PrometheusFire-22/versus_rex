Organizing your directories in a consistent and logical manner is crucial for maintainability and scalability, especially as your project grows. Here's a suggested structure for your project:

```
/
|-- .github/             # GitHub-specific configurations and CI/CD workflows
|-- db/
|   |-- migrations/      # Database migration scripts
|   |-- schemas/         # Initial database schemas
|   `-- seeds/           # Seed data for populating the database
|-- src/
|   |-- api/             # FastAPI or other API-related files
|   |-- core/            # Core business logic
|   |-- services/        # Services like email sending, external API interaction
|   `-- utils/           # Utility scripts and helper functions
|-- tests/               # Test suites and testing utilities
|-- notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and presentation
|-- scripts/             # Standalone scripts for maintenance, setup, etc.
`-- docs/                # Documentation files


Here's a breakdown of what each directory and file is for:

- `.github/workflows`: This contains your CI/CD workflow definitions.
- `migrations`: This includes all your database migration scripts.
- `seeds`: Here, you would put your database seed scripts, which populate your database with initial data.
- `schemas`: This can include your schema creation scripts or definitions.
- `tests`: This directory will contain your test scripts.
- `src`: This is where your main application code lives.
- `notebooks`: If you're using Jupyter notebooks for exploration or data analysis, you can keep them here.
- `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project.
- `README.md`: This is your project's readme file that includes information about your project, how to set it up, and how to use it.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages that your project depends on.
- `setup.py`: If you're creating a Python package, this setup script will include information about your package such as its name, version, and dependencies.

Keep in mind that this structure is just a suggestion and should be adapted to fit the specifics and requirements of your project. The key is to maintain an organization that makes sense for your workflow and is understandable to any collaborators.
